GObject-introspection based bindings generator for Go. Work in progress.

See 'documentation' dir for details.


At the moment build system is capable of building gtk-3.0 set only. Try it that way:

    ./waf configure build install

Or skip the install part:

    ./waf configure build

Install will install only libraries, it will skip the generator itself and the
demo app.

Build system is largely in alpha quality. It doesn't track all of the
dependencies and all that. All is a subject of ongoing work.


GObject-introspection is a new project, therefore it requires the set of fairly
recent both libraries and tools, here's the list of versions on my machine:

gobject-introspection    1.30.0
atk                      2.2.0
cairo                    1.10.2
gdk2/gtk2                2.24.8
gdk3/gtk3                3.2.3
gdk-pixbuf2              2.24.1
glib2                    2.30.2
gtksourceview3           3.2.3
pango                    1.29.4


Here's the short TODO list:
 - Implement unions (GdkEvent is the main user)
 - Implement the rest of gogtk-demo.
 - Implement the rest of typeconv.go functionality. Both Go -> C and C -> Go.
 - Think about adding "user_data" support for closures. At the moment my (nsf)
   opinion is that they are useless, because there are real language closures.
 - Go-gobject-gen needs a way to share code between gtk-2.0 and gtk-3.0.
