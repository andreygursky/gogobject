GObject-introspection based bindings generator for Go. Work in progress.

See 'documentation' dir for details.


Try building a set of bindings for gtk+-2.0 using all-2.0.bash script or for
gtk+-3.0 using all-3.0.bash script.


GObject-introspection is a new project, therefore it requires the set of fairly
recent both libraries and tools, here's the list of versions on my machine:

gobject-introspection    1.30.0
atk                      2.2.0
cairo                    1.10.2
gdk2/gtk2                2.24.8
gdk3/gtk3                3.2.3
gdk-pixbuf2              2.24.1
glib2                    2.30.2
gtksourceview3           3.2.3
pango                    1.29.4


Here's the short TODO list:
 - Implement unions (GdkEvent is the main user)
 - Go through all the API and rename as many functions as possible, typical
   examples are: SetHalign -> SetHAlign, .AddUiFromString -> .AddUIFromString,
   etc.
 - All interfaces should also embed interfaces of their parents. E.g.:
   gtk.WidgetLike embeds gobject.ObjectLike. It will make *Like interfaces more
   useful, because that way to will be able to pass them further to To*
   functions.
 - Implement the rest of gogtk-demo.
 - Implement the rest of typeconv.go functionality. Both Go -> C and C -> Go.
 - Think about adding "user_data" support for closures. At the moment my (nsf)
   opinion is that they are useless, because there are real language closures.
 - Go-gobject-gen needs a way to share code between gtk-2.0 and gtk-3.0.
